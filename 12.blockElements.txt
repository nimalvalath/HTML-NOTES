Block level elements
---------------------

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
The <div> element is a block-level element.

Examples of block-level elements:

    <div>
    <h1> - <h6>
    <p>
    <form>

Inline elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

    <span>
    <a>
    <img>
